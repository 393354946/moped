
Arctic Core - the open source AUTOSAR embedded platform

This software is meant as a starting kit for setting up an experimental platform for research and development
on cyber-physical systems. 

Arctic Core OS has been ported to the Raspberry Pi platform, being the only hardware supported by this code release.
The code also include drivers for sensors and actuators that are needed to drive an RC car, using a couple of Raspberry
Pis as control units.
