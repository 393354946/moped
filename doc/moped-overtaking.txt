Simple experiments with overtaking.

Car A follows a planned path along a road network. Car B stands still
(turned off) in the way. When A detects it using distance sensors, it
replans tactically so it uses the left lane to bypass B.

See moped-lasersensors.txt for how the information of an obstacle is
transmitted to the navigation code.

In nav1.py, the simple logic is that when an obstacle is seen (and we know
it must be a car in our way because we are far from the wall and we only
look in directions where a car would be in the way), the next five
nodes in our planning are changed so they are taken on the opposite
lane instead of the normal lane in the function nav1.overtake. The data
structure for a path was extended so it also contains an offset from the
middle line, normally -0.25 but now first 0 and then +0.25.

For running, we replace the usual 'eight' network with 'network2', which
is only a straight path along the right wall. The start and end points
get the numbers 101 and 114.

g.lev = 2
whole4([101,114])
