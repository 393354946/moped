* steering

-100 to 100




* speed

The value can be set to between -100 and 100. Negative numbers mean
reversing, but setting first a positive speed and then a negative one
will probably lead to 256+speed to being used. At least 0 should be
set explicitly. More things may be needed, but I don't understand this
yet. Possibly the steering should be set each time, too. Suitable pauses
are important, and it takes a while for the thing to start (at which time
the hardware beeps to indicate this).

Look at AP.java, Circle.java.



* LED

The LEDs are numbered 1 to 3. To light one, set it to 0. To extinguish,
set it to 1.

LED 1 = red?

Send a string like this to the port: "3|1".
