Some common groups of tasks you may want to do, depending on your role:


STATE C
A server is running, and a car is available, all set up.

c1) You want to write new plugins, upload them, install them on the car
and run them.  Without a physical car, perhaps the simulator is
enough. From moped, you need 'api' and 'simulator'.

c2) You want to add functions to the moped code running on the car; for
example: new sensors on an ECU, new tasks on the TCU, or fix bugs.
You need all of moped.


STATE B
A host exists, with mysql and wordpress installed and all the moped
code built.

b) You want to add users and add cars.

STATE A
A host exists, with nothing on it.

c) You want to install moped.
