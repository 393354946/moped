The car should be powered with about 8.4 V DC.

This can be done either with a LiPo battery or a DC power aggregate
(or what the name is).

On the voltage divider, there are four lights, showing the voltage. When
all four are steadily on, the voltage is fine. When only the red ones are
lit, the battery will soon run out (then all lights will flicker).

Only two red lights are lit in the interval 6.6-7.2V. One will flicker for
a short while and then go out. Then it's time to turn off.

* Charging the battery

Follow the instructions carefully.

It may happen that a battery depleted so nuch that it can't power the
Raspi's anymore will elicit the message "low voltage" or something
similar from the charger, which will then refuse to charge it. In that
case, it has always helped so far to simply wait a few hours before
trying again.

Charging a battery fully which has been depleted so that the rpi's
can't run anymore (it's then between 5.7 and 6.6 V) takes between 65
and 75 minutes.
