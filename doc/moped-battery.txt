The car should be powered with about 8.4 V DC.

This can be done either with a LiPo battery or a DC power aggregate
(or what the name is).

On the voltage divider, there are four lights, showing the voltage. When
all four are steadily on, the voltage is fine.

* Charging the battery

Follow the instructions carefully.

Charging a battery fully which has been depleted so that the rpi's
can't run anymore (it's then between 5.7 and 6.6 V) takes between 65
and 75 minutes.
