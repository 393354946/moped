Warning: this has not been checked for correctness lately.
The "fresta" thing will be renamed to "moped", I think.


Fetch and install mysql.

sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start
mysql -u root -proot

create user fresta identified by 'somepasswordxxx';

create database fresta;
    grant all privileges on fresta . * to 'fresta'@'%';
    flush privileges;

create database fresta2 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    grant all privileges on fresta2 . * to 'fresta'@'%';
    flush privileges;


Use a saved database dump to create and populate the tables:
mysql -uroot -proot < dump
If the dump doesn't say "use ..." on line 1, add such a line for the
appropriate database (mentioned in the comment further down).


If you selected other than root/root for the user/password, change
new-server/src/main/java/service/CallMySql.java accordingly.



The schema for MOPED is in new-server/fresta2-schema.
