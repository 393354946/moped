WirelessIno is a modification of https://github.com/MiichaelD/BluIno

cd WirelessIno
To get a build.xml, do
export PATH=$PATH:~/android/android-sdk-linux/tools:~/android/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
android update project --subprojects --path . --target 9
Then
rm -r bin
ant debug

Tapping on the circle at the top sends a message to the car.

The screen turns around if you turn the phone, as with many apps, but
this can be changed, somehow.

For the latest version of Android, I made a change to the code, so
