This supposes that you already have a development environment for Android.


cd WirelessIno
To get a build.xml, do
export PATH=$PATH:~/android/android-sdk-linux/tools:~/android/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools
android update project --subprojects --path . --target 9
Then
rm -r bin
ant debug

Put this on an Android phone somehow, via USB cable or a local web server.


The app doesn't detect loss of connection. You have to do Disconnect and
then setup again.
