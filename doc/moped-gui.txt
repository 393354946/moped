A car must be made the active vehicle for a user for it to show up in
the apps gallery.

In the GUI, press MOPED in the upper left to get to the inside of the
Wordpress site. There, go to User->Vehicle Association in the menu on
the left.





Currently, almost nothing in the GUI works if the server is not running.
