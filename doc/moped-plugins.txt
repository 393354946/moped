For clearing the simulator, do rm apps/* and rm db/*
And same in can-utils/java on the TCU.

TODO: describe what the plugin code should look like, and how it is
compiled.

The simulator only supports a subset of the sensors and actuators.
See moped-simulator.txt


Existing plugins:
For VCU:

    AdcPub
	publishes the battery value
    AP
	"auto path" - accelerates and turns here and there
    BWPub
    CL
    Circle
	runs at varying speeds in a small circle
    Comm1
    Comm2
	Comm1 and Comm2 run on separate ECU's and communicate
    DistPub
	publishes distance
    FWPub
    LEDLighter
	lights and extinguishes all three LEDs, periodically
    Platoon
    PluginCreationTest
	writes only something on stdout
    PluginCreationTest2
    PluginCreationTest3
    PosPub
    SemiAutomaticReverseParking

For SCU:
    IMUPub
    UltraSonicReader
	reads distance and sends it to a port where AutoBrake will read it


In addition, AutoBrake exists, but is not compilable. This may be easily
fixed. Also BurningWheels.
