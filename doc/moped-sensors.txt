* speed

This is computed from the frequency with which a light is turned into
pulses by reflectors distributed evenly on the inside of a wheel. Thus,
only the absolute value of the speed is reported.


Testing the speed sensor without actually using the motor is easy: rotate
one of the back wheels by hand (the mechanics make the other wheel rotate
in the other direction).
