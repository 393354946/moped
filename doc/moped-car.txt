The car has three Raspberry Pie boards, revision 2,
called TCU, SCU and VCU.

TCU = telemetric (something unit)
SCU = sensor
VCU = vehicle

VCU is connected to the steering and driving (both actuators and
sensors), as well as the LEDs. The speed sensors are at the inside of the
right wheels (but one of the sensor inputs is not used and is connected to
the steering angle instead).

When looking down at the car in its forward direction, the SCU is at
the front, the TCU at the left and the VCU at the right.


TCU runs Linux and handles all communication with the outside world.
It has an ethernet socket and two USB sockets, of which one should have
a wifi dongle (and the other may be connected to a keyboard). It has
a video socket, for connecting a screen. (So do the others, but there
these sockets are not used.)

SCU and VCU are very similar. They run autosar, but are not meant to run
exactly the same MOPED RTS code - the last building step is different.

The three boards communicate with a CAN bus.

All three boards have a list of 2x13 pins, described here:

At the front of the car is an ultra sound sensor.
Behind it are three LEDs: two yellow ones, and between them a red one.

Output (written by VM.println or printf) from SCU and VCU can be seen
by connecting a serial cable to the UART pins. I used one with USB and
plugged it into the computer, where I ran GtkTerm.
