I added a 4x7 LED display (7 segments, and actually a period too), which
uses I2C. SCU has code I2C, and otherwise uses this for the ADC. It's
probably possible to put both ADC and the display on the same I2C pins,
after setting a different device id on the display.

Sound: connected a small loudspeaker with 3.5mm audio and USB power (to
charge internal battery) to TCU. But taking power from the TCU is not
a good idea. Charge the speaker separately instead.
The small loudspeakers I bought at Clas Ohlson run without charging
for at least 12 hours (at least when not emitting sound). 5 minutes of
charging (whether turned on or not) gives one hour of use.
