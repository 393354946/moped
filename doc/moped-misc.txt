* Speeding up building server

Extract all maven repository files (in ~/.m2) to ~/jar-files
Then run original-server:
Delete our own jar files: server, ecm*, simulator
and there are three log4j, where only one is needed
java -cp ~/jar-files/'*':target/server.jar service.PluginWebServicePublisher
Remove the shade thing in pom.xml and the building takes half the time.
add this to how-to-build.txt

mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true

* Add the network of the Android on TCU

(after setting up one, using Internet shared surf point, or something)
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf


* settings.properties on TCU

Change
SERVER=appz-ext.sics.se

MQTT

The SCU writes to a port, which sends the data to TCU, which sends it
out (publishes).

The address of the MQTT server is set in ecm-linux/.../Main.java and
simulator/.../CarFactory.java.

============================================================

VCU and SCU have numbers: 2 = VCU and 3 = SCU. When relevant, 1 = TCU.

============================================================

Tips and tricks

If only the SCU needs to be restarted (because it got stuck, or because
its SD card needs to be updated), pull its power cable and put it in again.

If you put an ssh app on the Android, you can log in to the TCU without
a cable. Otherwise, you can use an ethernet cable from the TCU to your
computer.

When doing file operations on the TCU and then restarting the car, the
operations sometimes turn out to be undone. I think it's important
to do "sync" before restarting.

The dependencies within the modules are far from understood, so it's
best to always (yes, always) do a clean operation before rebuilding.

============================================================

If squawk is rebuilt, and a new kernel.img put on an ECU, all plugins
for that ECU need to be rebuilt, since their "hash codes" need to
coincide.

============================================================

When debugging the code on an ECU, printouts are normally not harmful,
but if they are performed very fast (deep inside the runtime system),
or in a sensitive place where they themselves may cause recursion
(memory allocation, symbol lookup), they may either hang the ECU
completely or make it behave erratically.

At least for the communication between TCU and SCU/VCU, timing cannot
be changed completely arbitrarily.

In Java, printing is done with VM.print or VM.println, whereas System.out
is ignored on autosar. The VM functions work on hosted platforms too,
though.

============================================================

Time taken to get the car started:

0  boot
33 TCU gets a wifi address (the dongle starts blinking in blue)
34 ECM starts
56 ECM connects to the server
68 SCU or VCU receives the first plugin
78 (if the plugin is 2400 bytes) the first plugin starts running
