I haven't yet been able to install three plugins on one ECU (different
ones, or reinstalling) without getting the error "out of memory".

Occasionally, the receiving of an installation package on an ECU from
the TCU fails, either because it never got everything (there is a
printout "ready?" followed by two numbers), or because the reading of
frames (the smallest units of data that are sent) got out of synch (there
is a printout "sequence error").

Performing the same operation again will probably be successful. If the
ECU crashed, it has to be restarted first.

When powered by the aggregate, trying to use the servo can make the TCU
(and maybe everything) immediately restart. When by battery, it works well.
I think this is due to a fall in voltage, not to a loose connection.

The ultrasonic sensor is handled in such a way that it must be
connected in order for the SCU to run at all: if even one pin is
disconnected, the SCU pauses or crashes.
