servo (scan about 180 degrees every 1s)

*ultrasound normally goes down to about 0.5 when approaching a wall, but
it reports 0.1 or less sometimes, rather than the actual minimum
how to filter off those?

separate file moped-calibration.txt?

ideas used for getting absolute position: RFID (needed an additional
RPi), dropping water, bumping over a small obstacle, dragging a mouse
    sudo od /dev/input/mouse0
    mouse.py
    dragging the mouse after the car for 12m gave
    (-2162, 13123), so it was a bit turned
    13300 pulses from the mouse means 1.1 pulses/mm


left and right rear odometer: used it for finding a good parameter to
use only right odometer and gyro.

scheduling in python: sleep(0.00001)

to the checklist of errors:
has the extra cable of the battery inserted itself in the servo?
does the left odometer report anything?
if the IMU won't be inited: some pin may be loose - just wiggle them a
 little
if the speeds don't work, restart VCU
if leftspeed is less than rightspeed when driving straight, or standing
loose, clean the lens or the reflective patches or adjust the cube
 a little

electric brake:
I think the opposite sign needs to be sent continuously, so we have to
remove the optimization in senddrive.
big difference for speed 100 but not much for speed 50
investigate further

steering hysteresis

magnetometer

camera, clean lens

don't let the battery sensor cable get stuck in the servo

adjust cogwheels
