Tested with wordpress 3.6 and 4.1.


1) Install wordpress, put it in /var/www/wp

2) Copy in the files from moped/webportal/wordpress

cd wp
cp -rp ~/moped/moped/webportal/wordpress/custom .
cp -rp ~/moped/moped/webportal/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/groups .
cp -rp ~/moped/moped/webportal/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/moped .
cp -rp ~/moped/moped/webportal/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/vehicle-config* .

3) Add this to wp-content/themes/twentythirteen/functions.php:

/** Include Moped functions */
include(get_template_directory()."/../../../custom/moped_functions.php");


4) Set WP_DEBUG to true in wp-config.php, in case something fails. Set it
to false again when things work, because on some pages, there are some
harmless but annoying warnings.

5) Add https to Apache. This is not needed for moped to work, but may be
needed for wordpress administration.

6) Add users to wordpress. Moped users should also be added to both the
developer and engineer groups.

7) Once you have users in the wordpress user table, dump that table and
enter it as fresta2.wp_users so the trusted server also sees the users.
